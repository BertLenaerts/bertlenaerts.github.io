1.1	Empirical model
-------------

To set up our model we follow Egger and Nelson (2011) who employ an empirical gravity model for panel data. They include two sets of variables: antidumping measures and other trade frictions. The former consists of a count variable reflecting the number of antidumping investigations importing country j has initiated against exporting country i in year t (ADijt). Secondly, we use the cumulative number of antidumping investigations an economy j has launched against country i until year t (CADijt). This would capture a possibly long memory in trade. 

A second set of variables captures bilateral trade frictions. Since trade cost itself is not readily available, geographic distance and four measures of economic distance are used instead. Geographic distance is measured as bilateral great circle distances between two countries' capitals (DISTij). Economic distance includes a dummy variable that takes the value 1 in the absence of a common border and 0 otherwise (NBORDij), a cultural (language) distance variable that is l in the absence of a common ofﬁcial language and 0 otherwise (NLANGij), and two variables indicating (the absence of) common regional trade agreement membership for each country pair and year—one for customs unions (NCUijt) and the other one for free trade areas (NFTAijt).

To estimate a fixed-effect gravity model for panel data, one can control for both bilateral and multilateral trade barriers. Bilateral trade frictions are captured by exporter (CTYi) and importer (PTNj) fixed-effects dummies (Redding and Venables, 2004) as the time-invariant variables (distance, border and language) are of interest.

To complete the model, we add year-fixed-effects (YEARt) to control for macroeconomic shocks and a time trend (t) to proxy for technical progress. To reduce the problem of heteroskedasticity, we take the natural logarithm of both distance and the dependent variable (export volumes, Xijt). Following Anderson and Van Wincoop (2004), we transform export volumes by subtracting importer and exporter GDP: lnX_ijt≡ln〖EXP〗_ijt-ln〖GDP〗_it-ln〖GDP〗_jt. Our prime model of interest is the bilateral gravity model: 

$$lnX_ijt=α_1 AD_ijt+α_2 CAD_ijt+α_3 NCU_ijt+α_4 NFTA_ijt+α_5 lnDIST_ij+α_6 NBORD_ij+α_7 NLANG_ij+γ_1 YEAR_t+γ_2 t+γ_3 CTY_i+γ_4 PTN_j+u_ijt$$
