1 Method
=============

1.1	Empirical model
-------------

To set up our model we follow Egger and Nelson (2011) who employ an empirical gravity model for panel data. They include two sets of variables: antidumping measures and other trade frictions. The former consists of a count variable reflecting the number of antidumping investigations importing country j has initiated against exporting country i in year t (ADijt). Secondly, we use the cumulative number of antidumping investigations an economy j has launched against country i until year t (CADijt). This would capture a possibly long memory in trade. 

A second set of variables captures bilateral trade frictions. Since trade cost itself is not readily available, geographic distance and four measures of economic distance are used instead. Geographic distance is measured as bilateral great circle distances between two countries' capitals (DISTij). Economic distance includes a dummy variable that takes the value 1 in the absence of a common border and 0 otherwise (NBORDij), a cultural (language) distance variable that is l in the absence of a common ofﬁcial language and 0 otherwise (NLANGij), and two variables indicating (the absence of) common regional trade agreement membership for each country pair and year—one for customs unions (NCUijt) and the other one for free trade areas (NFTAijt).

To estimate a fixed-effect gravity model for panel data, one can control for both bilateral and multilateral trade barriers. Bilateral trade frictions are captured by exporter (CTYi) and importer (PTNj) fixed-effects dummies (Redding and Venables, 2004) as the time-invariant variables (distance, border and language) are of interest.

To complete the model, we add year-fixed-effects (YEARt) to control for macroeconomic shocks and a time trend (t) to proxy for technical progress. To reduce the problem of heteroskedasticity, we take the natural logarithm of both distance and the dependent variable (export volumes, Xijt). Following Anderson and Van Wincoop (2004), we transform export volumes by subtracting importer and exporter GDP: lnX_ijt≡ln〖EXP〗_ijt-ln〖GDP〗_it-ln〖GDP〗_jt. Our prime model of interest is the bilateral gravity model: 

$lnX_{ijt}=\alpha_1 AD_{ijt}+\alpha_2 CAD_{ijt}+\alpha_3 NCU_{ijt}+\alpha_4 NFTA_{ijt}+\alpha_5 lnDIST_{ij}+\alpha_6 NBORD_{ij}+$
$\alpha_7 NLANG_{ij}+\gamma_1 YEAR_t+\gamma_2 t+\gamma_3 CTY_i+\gamma_4 PTN_j+u_{ijt}$

1.2	Estimation strategy
-------------
Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation can be problematic in a panel setting. In fact, when the number of individuals (cross-sectional units, N) is large, using robust inference is considered good practice, even without testing for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. To adjust standard errors in a panel setting, different mechanisms exist. Under the assumption of independently (but not identically) distributed residuals, Eicker (1967), Huber (1967) and White (1980) propose standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity. An important drawback of these so-called White standard errors is the requirement that the number of time periods (T) is large (because the within transformation induces serial or temporal correlation) and no serial correlation is present (Stock and Watson, 2008). 

To relax these assumptions, so-called Rogers or clustered standard errors are available (Arellano, 1987; Froot, 1989; Rogers, 1993). Clustered standard errors have gained considerable popularity in recent years because they not only allow for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation, but within-cluster correlation as well. However, requirements for correct implementation somewhat limit the potential of adjusting for spatial correlation through clustering. 

Firstly, to allow for within-cluster correlation, no between-cluster correlation may be present and the number of clusters needs to be large (typically at least 20-50). The panel variable must also be nested within the cluster variable (again, because the within transformation induces serial correlation) (StataCorp, 2017). For the typical case of US firms or cities, clustering on the state- or industry-level is preferable due to likely correlation between firms or cities. Still, the number of industries or states might be too low (e.g. with unbalanced panels). Therefore, there is a latent trade-off in correct cluster-robust inference because larger cluster aggregation levels show less correlation but are also smaller in number. 

Lastly, to allow for serial correlation, clustering on the panel ID level is needed (StataCorp, 2017). This, however, forces us the make the assumption that the disturbances are independently distributed over the panels (cluster level). Thus, a second trade-off emerges: when using clustering to adjust for serial correlation, no cross-sectional correlation is allowed. Lastly, to account for serial correlation, the number of individuals must be substantially larger than the number of time periods (Wooldridge, 2013).

Focusing on the issue of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation, consistent standard errors can also be obtained by the Newey-West procedure (Newey and West, 1987). Contrary to previous approaches that allow for general patterns of serial correlation (including no pattern), the Newey-West method requires specification of the number of time lags. Essentially, this estimator is an extension to White standard errors and Newey–West standard errors with lag length zero will collapse to White standard errors. 

Previous approaches have ignored the possibility of errors being correlated across (groups of) individuals (cross-sectional or spatial dependence). A practical way around this is to assume that the cross-sectional correlations are identical for every pair of individuals. Under this assumption, time-fixed-effects (dummies) capture and thus remove the spatial dependence (Hoechle, 2007). Alternatively, Driscoll and Kraay (1998) proposed a more general procedure. The corresponding Driscoll-Kraay or spatial correlation consistent (SCC) standard errors are robust to general forms of both spatial and serial dependence. A drawback of Driscoll-Kraay standard errors is their reliance on large-T asymptotic theory.

Lastly, we can also use bootstrapping as a general way of correcting standard errors. However, as bootstrapping assumes (spatial and serial) independence, the simple random bootstrap is not expected to improve the standard errors much (Dixon, 2001). Instead, bootstrapping is performed on clustered standard errors. With this type of bootstrapping, every sample drawn during each replication is a bootstrap sample of clusters and a new variable containing an unique identifier for each resampled cluster is required.

1.3	Data
-------------
The data used in this analysis was taken from the online repository for the Review of Economics and Statistics (Harvard Dataverse). More specifically, we used the dataset as compiled by Egger and Nelson (2011) for their study on the effects of antidumping on trade. We refer to their publication for more information on the variables used.

2	Results & discussion
=============

Table 1 presents different panel data models. Our variable of interest (ADijt) does not differ much between the different models, with the exception of the first difference model. The others variables, however, vary considerably between the different models. The null hypothesis of no individual specific effects is rejected for both the fixed- and random-effects model, which is not surprising given the large N (and small T). Based on the Hausman test, the fixed-effects model is preferred. Here we present three such models: the country fixed-effects, the bilateral fixed-effects and the bilateral first difference model. The latter, however, violates the strict exogeneity assumption. The exogeneity assumption is violated here if one of the lead variables is significant at the 5% level.

Because we are also interested in the time-invariant variables, we choose country fixed-effects as our main model. Note that the distance effect in the country fixed-effects model is positive and non-significant while it is usually negative and significant (Disdier and Head, 2008). This result might be due to a lack of geographic representation in the dataset—for example, Germany has as many export partners (over the years) as Grenada, which seems implausible.

Table 2 presents standard errors for the country fixed-effects model using different adjustment mechanisms. In general, the non-clustered standard errors differ only slightly from the unadjusted (OLS) errors. The clustered errors—whether using importer, exporter or bilateral pairs as cluster level, and whether bootstrapped or not—however, are several times higher than de OLS errors. Consequently, the variables NLANGij, NCUijt and NFTAijt lose their significance using the clustered standard errors. Assuming the OLS errors are biased due to heteroskedasticity and serial correlation, the small differences with the White, Newey–West, Driscoll–Kraay and simple bootstrap adjusted errors, are problematic. The White and simple bootstrap standard errors were not expected ex ante to perform well. The failure of the Newey–West  errors might be due to the higher-lag nature of the serial correlation while that of the Driscoll–Kraay errors may be caused by its reliance on large T samples. Due to the low number of supranational regions (e.g. continents), we did not cluster on an aggregated level—if spatial autocorrelation is a serious concerns, spatial panel models are preferred. Driscoll–Kraay standard errors could in theory help to solve spatial autocorrelation. In this application, however, the Driscoll–Kraay adjustment does not seem to work well, again possibly due to its reliance on large T samples.
