Last semester, I was given the amazing opportunity  of spending a semester at the Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, 
part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Greater Boston. Every six weeks I reported on my adventures in a blog series
called MIT Monday. In these blogs, I talked about the reason for my stay, my research, the Fulbright scholarship I received, Greater Boston and MIT and 
my final impressions.

<h3>1. Land of the free, home of the brave (Oct 22, 2018)</h3>

<h4>Land of opportunities</h4>

November 12th, 2017. An email pops up. Ideas and plans finally turn into reality: next fall, I am going to Boston. 

Who am I? My name is Bert and I am a second year Ph.D. student within the Environmental Economics research group at the Faculty of Business Economics from Hasselt University. This fall, I will travel to the U.S.A. to work in the laboratories of the prestigious Massachusetts Institute for Technology, better known as MIT. I am deeply honored that I have been invited for an external research stay. Up until now, I could not even imagine in my wildest dreams how working at MIT would look like….

So how will life be in the US of Trump? Is it as bad as is often claimed on the news? Are my friends and family right to question my sanity in going there? Is there any truth to these stories? My scientific curiosity  got the better of me and now I will be able to experience it all first hand. And don't worry, I will tell you all about it in my next blogs.

<h4>The lure of flying </h4>

What will I be investigating during my research stay? Good question. It has everything to do with the manner of transportation that I will use to get there: airplanes. More specifically, I am interested in aviation and the airline industry around it and will be working in the Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment. Air transportation has become increasingly popular in recent decades. Since 1980, prices have halved while the number of passengers increased tenfold, resulting in flying becoming more accessible. That's not only nice for people looking for a holiday abroad, also businesses might benefit. That is why the governments in both the US and Europe have and still are subsidizing (small) airports. But just how much do airports add to economic growth? What is their value? And how can we quantify this? These are precisely the questions I hope to answer in my research. 

However, flying that cheap comes at a cost. If all the airlines were combined into one country, it would rank in the top 10 emitters. Me coming to the US and going back home by plane will emit as much greenhouse gasses as heating up my apartment for the entire research stay. To make matters even worse, the number of air passengers will double in the next two decades while emissions from airlines are not even in the Paris agreement. Apart from studying the economic impact of aviation, my future research will therefore also focus on the environmental footprint of the airline industry as well. But more on that in a later post. 

Last but not least, going abroad also means meeting new people, experiencing different cultures, and representing your own country as well. I am looking forward to sharing all of this with you in the coming months. Welcome to MIT Monday!

<h3>2. To profit or not to profit (Nov 12, 2018)</h3>

<h4>Should I fly?</h4>

In my previous blog, I announced that I am going to spend a semester working at the Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, which is part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT). There, I will use my time and resources to investigate the economic impact of aviation. That all sounds nice, but why would someone need to travel across the Atlantic to do just that? Kind of hypocritical given the fact that previously I was talking about the booming numbers of passengers and the impact this has on our environment. Let's back up a little to put things in perspective.

<h4>Fostering economic growth</h4>

The first question we must ask ourselves is the following: given the steep rise in airborne transportation, is aviation a profitable business? Not necessarily. A little under two decades ago, Belgium witnessed the loss of its crumbling flag carrier with the bankruptcy of the Belgian national airline Sabena. November 2001 marked one of the biggest economic failures in history.

Yet despite the lurking financial problems, the debate about whether the Belgian government should invest continued until the very end. In fact, before the closure, the government had already invested several billion into the company. Similar stories can be told about Air France, before its merger with KLM, and Alitalia. So why do governments keep investing in unprofitable enterprises?

A much-heard argument — and for policymakers, perhaps the most important — is that air transport creates employment and fosters economic growth. Keeping employment up is certainly a strong political motive. For example, the bankruptcy of Sabena left thousands of people unemployed overnight. Proponents of government intervention also feared that economically unviable connections would not survive in the market, thereby losing their catalytic effect on the wider economy.

But is this argument really justified? To which extent do more or better air services lead to more economic growth? Or does more economic growth rather lead to more or better air services? To date, it is unclear whether increased air accessibility has a positive impact on the wider economy in general, as, though often studied both qualitative and quantitatively, no unambiguous answer has yet emerged from the literature.

<h4>Doing things differently</h4>

In my research, I want to do things a bit differently. Unlike previous studies, I do not look at traffic volumes. Instead, I use a connectivity metric that takes into account both the quality of the connection (using one or two connecting flights) and the economic size of the destination. And this is where MIT comes in, as they have the data and computer power to calculate such a metric.

Secondly, we do not focus on large cities (who have an airport) only. I  include smaller regions as well by integrating the distance between a centre of population and all available airports, in my calculations. This approach not only looks at a more realistic sample of regions, but it also reflects the travelling distance to the airport. After all, people—with the possible exception of Tom Hanks' character Viktor Navorski—do not live in airports!
