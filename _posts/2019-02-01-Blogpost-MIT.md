Last semester, I was given the amazing opportunity  of spending a semester at the Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, 
part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Greater Boston. Every six weeks I reported on my adventures in a blog series
called MIT Monday. In these blogs, I talked about the reason for my stay, my research, the Fulbright scholarship I received, Greater Boston and MIT and 
my final impressions.
